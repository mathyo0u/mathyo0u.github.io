                <p>Auraponics is looking to fundamentally change the agricultural industry. We believe that no one should have to put up with low quality produce or 
                  inflated prices just because they live in an area that didn’t win the farming lottery.
                  Our goal is to bring low cost, high quality produce to every corner of the globe.

                <p>Our indoor farming system allows anyone to grow plants indoors without needing to care for them.
                   The Aura One works by precisely metering out the exact right amount of nutrients, and maintains the ideal pH level for your plant then sprays the nutrient water directly to the plants roots. Low power LEDs provide sufficient light for the plants to prosper. Additionally, elevated CO2 levels are maintained to increase the growth rate of the plants by up to 50% compared to basic soil.   The pH level, nutrient level, and CO2 level can all be monitored right on your smartphone.
                   You can even change the settings yourself to find the ultimate combination for your plants.

System details
 Our indoor farming system allows anyone to grow plants indoors without needing to care for them. The Aura One works by precisely metering out the exact right amount of nutrients, and maintains the ideal pH level for your plant then sprays the nutrient water directly to the plants roots. Low power LEDs provide sufficient light for the plants to prosper. Additionally, elevated CO2 levels are maintained to increase the growth rate of the plants by up to 50% compared to basic soil.   The pH level, nutrient level, and CO2 level can all be monitored right on your smartphone. You can even change the settings yourself to find the ultimate combination for your plants. 

Introducing 

Introducing the Aura One, The first low-cost indoor farming solution that not only allows anyone to grow their favorite fruit, 
vegetable or herb, also but does so faster than anyone else. 

Efficiency
The Aura One doesn’t use any pesticides and uses 90% less water over traditional farming. 

Our LED lights only illuminate the light wavelengths that plants need to grow. 

By spraying the roots with a fine mist intermittently, it allows the plant roots to intake more oxygen which is vital for their growth.
